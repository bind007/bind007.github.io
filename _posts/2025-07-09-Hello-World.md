This is my first entry in my personal blog. Find yourself in a free minded space.

No pressure, without compromise, all ideas accepted. From code lines to theories, to everyday life of a tech guy or engineer.

First comes respect and encouragement of each fellow technical person. It's the maxima by wich my life is rigged, when there is respect and good energy, all you can do is progress.
The idea behind this blog is far transcendental, I will share studies of my own, personal projects and opinion, but in the long way it's meant to create the chance of connecting with people.
I'm a simple person, creating what it's to be a space to share my work under the alias Bind007.
Don't hesitate in sharing your thoughts in this space, your opinion of certain topics or just random curiosities, I'm ears opened as I expect this from everyone.

Welcome to bind007! :)
